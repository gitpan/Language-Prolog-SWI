Language/Prolog/SWI
===================

This is a wrapper package for the Prolog C/C++ implementation SWI-Prolog

  http://www.swi-prolog.org/

PREREQUISITES

To build and run this extension you need the following

  - SWI-Prolog (from the URL above), any 5.0.x version should do

    Note: Debian users should install

    apt-get install swi-prolog
    apt-get install swi-prolog-clib
    apt-get install swi-prolog-doc

  - libtool

    Note: Debian users should install

    apt-get install libtool              - Generic library support script
    apt-get install libtool-doc          - Generic library support script

  - SWI-Prolog shareable object (see the HINTS file)

    You will need the sources for SWI-Prolog for that. Sorry, no debianization yet

  - SWIG (only necessary for building)

    Note: Debian users should install

    apt-get install swig1.3              - Generate scripting interfaces to C/C++ code.
    apt-get install swig1.3-examples     - Examples for applications of SWIG.


INSTALLATION

To install this module do the following:

- check the prerequisites above

- edit Makefile.PL and set the variable TOP to where SWIG maintains
  its examples:

     If you have installed from the sources, this might be

         /usr/local/src/SWIG-1.3.14/Examples/

     If you installed via Debian then the usual place is

         /usr/doc/swig1.3/examples

     You should gunzip the Makefile:

         gunzip Makefile.gz

- do the usual thing:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

CONTENT

  - Perl packages
      Language::Prolog::SWI::base (introduction, top level)
      Language::Prolog::SWI       (real wrapper package)

  - C++ class definition SWIProlog.cpp

  - SWIG interface file SWI.i
